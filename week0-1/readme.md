## Week 0
It was about basic revision of html and css, basically a warm-up before diving into js.

## Week 1
This is where things started actually
1. Orientation class
2. How to solve assignments
3. JS Foundations revision
4. Basic JS apis (methods)
5. Loops
6. Callbacks etc.
7. Async programming, Promises

## Browsers working
Browser is a software that renders html, css and js.
Browsers can only understand these 3.

## Why languages
Because computers cant understand english thats why

## Compilation
Process of converting code to machine code. This process involves 2 steps.
1. Lexical analysis: Converting code to short tokens, called tokenization process.
2. Syntactic analysis: Converting tokens to abstract syntax tree.

## Interpretation

Code gets executed line by line. Interpretation is faster than compilation since each line is execeuted one by one

## Static vs. Dynamic Languages
Tightly or loosely typed languages are static or dynamic languages, meaning that they have a strict or flexible type system.

Dynamic languages like js, python etc does not explicitely ask to specify the datatype that is being used.

Static languages ask for datatype

ex: 

```cpp

// static language c++
int variableName = 10;
float floatValue = 3.14;
bool booleanValue = true;
```

```js
let data = "Hello World!"
const newData = 123;
```

## Nature of Javascript
JS is single threaded in nature, meaning that it can only execute one task at a time. This is why javascript is slow as well.
